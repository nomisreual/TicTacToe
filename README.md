# Tic-Tac-Toe Terminal Game

This is a python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe as a command-line game. Thus far, the game only supports one game mode: multiplayer. A game mode playing against the computer is planned but not yet implemented.

## How to play?
Run the tictactoe.py file and you are good to go. The other files are required as they hold all dependencies the game needs.
